                        How to measure neck size?
                    </a>
                    <div class="answer">
                        Loop a measuring tape around the middle of your dog's neck making sure it is a bit TIGHT, fitted with no room and not easy to turn.
Check our measurment instruction video bottom of this page.
*If you do not have a tape measure, you can use a piece of string and then measure the string with a rigid ruler. All sizes in cm.

                    <div class="answer">
                        After time leather will naturally soften and may stretch slightly but this will not impact on the functionality of the item.

                        No. We finish off our leather products with a protecting leather balm which provides some temporary water resistance.
